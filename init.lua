-- NOTE: nixCats: this just gives nixCats global command a default value
-- so that it doesnt throw an error if you didnt install via nix.
-- usage of both this setup and the nixCats command is optional,
-- but it is very useful for passing info from nix to lua so you will likely use it at least once.

  -- this list literally just tells lazy.nvim not to download the plugins in the list.
  pluginList = require('nixCatsUtils.lazyCat').mergePluginTables(allPlugins.start, allPlugins.opt)

  -- it wasnt detecting that these were already added
  -- because the names are slightly different from the url.
  -- when that happens, add them to the list, then also specify the new name in the lazySpec
  pluginList[ [[Comment.nvim]] ] = ''
  pluginList[ [[LuaSnip]] ] = ''
  -- alternatively you can do it all in the plugins spec instead of modifying this list.
  -- just set the name and then add `dev = require('nixCatsUtils').lazyAdd(false, true)` to the spec

  -- HINT: to view the names of all plugins downloaded via nix, use the `:NixCats pawsible` command.

  -- we also want to pass in lazy.nvim's path
  -- so that the wrapper can add it to the runtime path
  -- as the normal lazy installation instructions dictate

-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
--
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.
-- NOTE: nixCats: this the lazy wrapper.
require('nixCatsUtils.lazyCat').setup(pluginList, nixLazyPath, {
  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
  'tpope/vim-sleuth', -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  --
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --
  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})

  -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
  -- NOTE: nixCats: nix downloads it with a different file name.
  -- tell lazy about that.
  { 'numToStr/Comment.nvim', name = 'comment.nvim', opts = {} },

  -- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
  -- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
  --    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
  --
  -- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
  { -- Adds git related signs to the gutter, as well as utilities for managing changes
    'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
    opts = {
      signs = {
        add = { text = '+' },
        change = { text = '~' },
        delete = { text = '_' },
        topdelete = { text = '‚Äæ' },
        changedelete = { text = '~' },
      },
    },
  },

  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
  --
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  --
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  --
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  --
  -- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded:
  --  config = function() ... end

  { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
    'folke/which-key.nvim',
    event = 'VimEnter', -- Sets the loading event to 'VimEnter'
    config = function() -- This is the function that runs, AFTER loading
      require('which-key').setup()

      -- Document existing key chains
      require('which-key').add {
        { '<leader>c', group = 'Code' },
        { '<leader>c_', hidden = true },
        { '<leader>d', group = 'Document' },
        { '<leader>d_', hidden = true },
        { '<leader>r', group = 'Rename' },
        { '<leader>r_', hidden = true },
        { '<leader>s', group = 'Search' },
        { '<leader>s_', hidden = true },
        { '<leader>t', group = 'Toggle' },
        { '<leader>t_', hidden = true },
        { '<leader>w', group = 'Workspace' },
        { '<leader>w_', hidden = true },
        {
          mode = { 'v' },
          { '<leader>h', group = 'Git Hunk' },
          { '<leader>h_', hidden = true },
        },
      }
    end,
  },

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

  { -- You can easily change to a different colorscheme.
